(mesenchyme) by a thin layer of highly organized extracellular matrix (ECM)\\nproteins that comprise the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ).', 'This type of ECM is\\ncategorized as a supramolecular matrix arrangement termed basement membrane\\n(BM), to which are added anchoring proteins that serve to reinforce dermo-epidermal\\ncohesion.', 'BMs compartmentalize, provide structural support, and regulate cell\\nbehavior through signaling activities that influence tissue growth, guide cell migration,\\nand support cell survival (2, 3).', 'Largely populated by keratinocytes, the epidermis\\nundergoes constant turnover as epidermal stem cells of the basal layer, which have a\\nhigh proliferative potential, constantly generate new daughter cells or transit-\\namplifying cells.', 'After a few cycles of division, daughter cells begin a process of\\nterminal differentiation (cornification), leading to the formation of the stratum corneum\\n(4).', 'Epidermal integrity and renewal depend on the balance between proliferation and\\ndifferentiation of the basal layer of keratinocytes that are in contact with the BM.', 'Additionally, various growth factors, morphogens, and other regulatory\\nmacromolecules tethered to the BM provide signals involved in governing\\nkeratinocyte adhesion, differentiation, stratification, and survival (5, 6).', 'One particularity of the DEJ is that it includes very sophisticated anchoring\\nproteins, which reinforce the cohesion between dermis and epidermis, and thereby\\nincrease the epidermis’ resistance to the mechanical forces to which the skin is\\nconstantly subjected.', 'These anchoring complexes link basal keratinocytes via\\nattachment dots called hemidesmosomes that span the BM and anchor the dermis\\nthrough specific elements called anchoring fibrils.', 'These essential structures contain\\n specific components, such as a6f4 integrin, laminin (LM) isoform 332, and collagens\\nVil and XVII (7).', 'The DEJ is formed through contributions from both epidermal and\\ndermal cells (8), and it exhibits a distinctive microarchitecture characterized by an\\nundulating pattern due to epidermal projections into the dermis that intercalate\\nbetween dermal papillae (7, 9).', 'This BM geometry increases the surface area of the\\nDEJ, strengthens the dermal—epidermal connectivity, and imposes mechanical\\nconstraints on keratinocytes with consequences on their fate (9).', 'Thus, the function\\nof the epidermis relies on mechanical, structural, and biochemical support from the\\nSTRUCTURAL ORGANIZATION OF THE DERMAL-EPIDERMAL JUNCTION\\nWithin the skin, the DEJ provides essential structural support to the adjacent\\nbasal epidermal keratinocytes (10, 11), constituting a specific informative niche that\\nmediates signals and plays a preponderant role in epidermal renewal (12).', 'The basic\\nstructure of the DEJ can be viewed as a BM assembled according to the commonly\\naccepted model (5, 8, 13).', 'The BM framework is comprised of two independent\\nnetworks of polymerized LMs and cross-linked collagen IV that are interconnected\\nand stabilized by the glycoprotein nidogen and the heparan sulphate (HS)\\nproteoglycan, perlecan (Fig.', '1).', 'Collagen IV is the most abundant structural\\ncomponent of the BM, and it is largely responsible for its mechanical properties (14,\\n15).', 'The combination of three a collagen chains, a101a2(IV) is the most abundant\\ncollagen IV molecule in all BMs (16), while the a5a5a6(IV) isoform is also present in\\nthe DEJ (17).', 'Collagen IV a chains contain an N-terminal 7S domain, a central\\ncollagen domain, and a C-terminal non-collagenous (NC)1 domain (18).', 'This\\nstructure enables collagen IV molecules to self-aggregate into dimers through their\\n NC1 domains, and into tetramers through their N-terminal 7S domains, leading to\\nformation of a hexameric network (Fig.', '1) (19).', 'It is believed that the covalent\\ncrosslinks of the collagen IV meshed network are central to the mechanical\\nproperties of the BM (20-22).', 'Although collagen IV may be essential for BM integrity, it is not critical to its\\ninitial formation (23).', 'Indeed, LM is considered the initiator of BM assembly at the\\nbasolateral surface of cells.', 'Secreted LMs are comprised of a, B, and y chains\\nassembled into a heterotrimer that has an asymmetrical, cruciform shape (Fig.', '1)\\n(24).', 'CDNA sequencing has led to identification of the primary structures of five LM a\\nchains (a1, a2, a3, a4, and a5), four B chains (61, B2, 83, and B4), and three y\\nchains (y1, y2, and y3), yielding at least 18 heterotrimeric isoforms (25).', 'Moreover,\\ndue to alternative splicing, the gene encoding the a3 chain produces two splice\\nvariants: a short-a3A chain and a long-a3B.', 'As long as each of the three constituent\\nLM chains includes an N-terminal LN domain, LMs can self-associate into polymeric,\\nsheet-like networks (26-28).', 'These LM networks are mainly non-covalent in nature,\\nallowing dynamic interactions.', 'To initiate BM assembly, the laminin G-type (LG)\\nmodules LG1—LG5 at the C-terminus of the a chain, which protrude from the LM long\\narm, bind directly to cells through cell surface receptors: integrins, a-dystroglycan,\\nand sulfated glycolipids (29, 30).', 'This property enables recruitment of other BM\\ncomponents, including nidogen, collagen IV, and perlecan, in a temporal hierarchy\\n(Fig.', '1) (31, 32).', 'The LM network of the epidermal BM results from self-assembly of\\nthe heterotrimer a581y1 or LM-511.', 'Various analyses have revealed that the\\nsupramolecular organization of BMs is asymmetrical and bifunctional.', 'The two faces\\nhave different exposed proteins: a LM-rich epithelial side and a collagen-rich stromal\\nside (33).', 'Atomic force microscopic studies have revealed that BM polarization is\\n characterized by distinct mechanical properties, the epithelial side being 2-4 times\\nstiffer than the stromal side (33).', 'Two other LM isoforms found in the DEJ, LM-332 (a3AB3y2) and LM-311\\n(a3AB1y1) (34-36), are unable to self-assemble because their constitutive a3 and/or\\ny2 chains are truncated at the N-terminal end, such that they lack the required LN\\ndomains.', 'However, networks containing LM-332 have been purified from skin,\\nindicating that some form of LM assembly occurs (37).', 'Their integration follows a\\ndifferent type of assembly pattern specific to BMs underlying epithelia that are\\nsubjected to strong mechanical forces, such as the DEJ (36, 38).', 'For integration into\\nthe DEJ, LM-332 first cross-links with LM-311, forming a complex better equipped for\\nintegration (34, 39).', 'In addition, both monomeric LM-332 and the LM-332/311 dimer\\nassociate with the N-terminal NC1 domain of collagen VII (40, 41).', 'Collagen VII\\nhomotrimers a1a101(VII) dimerize and form fibrillar structures, called anchoring\\nfibrils, which firmly connect the DEJ to the superficial dermis.', 'Dermal epidermal\\ncohesion depends on the interaction that occurs within the LN domain of the LM 63\\nchain and the fibronectin-like III repeats within the NC1 domain of collagen VII (42,\\n43).', 'LM-332 is critical for dermo-epidermal anchorage, because it associates with\\nbasal epidermal keratinocytes through its C-terminal domains, initiating and\\nmaintaining hemidesmosomes, and binding to collagen VII through its N-terminus (7,\\n36).', 'Hemidesmosomes are highly organized adhesion structures formed in the basal\\nlayer of the epidermis, where they link the BM with the keratin-containing\\nintermediate filament cytoskeleton, providing mechanical strength and durability (44).', 'Both LM-332/311 and LM-511 are secreted from keratinocytes, and they incorporate\\ninto the BM zone of hair follicles and interfollicular epidermis.', 'Another component of\\nthis specialized cell-BM interface category is collagen XVII, a transmembrane\\n collagen homotrimer a1a1a1(XVII) (45).', 'Collagen XVII plays a crucial role in\\nkeratinocyte anchorage by binding
